# Image Compression Model In Image Processesing

# Introduction to Image Compression:-
Image compression is a fundamental technique that reduces the file size of images, making storage, transmission, and processing more efficient. There are two primary types of compression:
•	Lossless Compression: No information is lost; the original image can be perfectly reconstructed. Examples: PNG, GIF.
•	Lossy Compression: Some data is discarded to achieve higher compression ratios, resulting in a smaller file size but a potential loss in quality. Example: JPEG.

# Image Compression Model Overview
The image compression model consists of two main components: the Encoder and Decoder. Process Flow:

# Original Image → Encoder → Compressed Bitstream → Decoder → Reconstructed Image

# The Encoder:
The encoder is responsible for converting the original image into a compressed bitstream through three main stages: Transformation, Quantization, and Entropy Coding.
# 1. Transformation
Transforms convert the image from the spatial domain (pixel values) to a frequency domain to identify patterns and redundancies.
•	Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT): Widely used in JPEG compression; converts the image into frequency coefficients.
•	Wavelet Transform: Utilized in JPEG2000; provides multi-resolution analysis, effectively compressing different frequency components.

# 2. Quantization
Quantization reduces the precision of the transformed coefficients, contributing to data reduction.
•	Uniform Quantization: Uses the same step size for all coefficients.
•	Non-uniform Quantization: Applies different step sizes based on the importance of coefficients.

# 3. Entropy Coding
Entropy coding compresses the quantized coefficients by encoding frequent patterns with fewer bits.
•	Huffman Coding: Assigns shorter codes to frequently occurring values.
•	Arithmetic Coding: Provides higher compression by representing the entire data sequence as a single code.

# The Compressed Bitstream:-
The output of the encoder is a highly efficient compressed bitstream that represents the original image in a significantly reduced form, suitable for storage or transmission.
The Decoder
The decoder reverses the encoding process to reconstruct the image.
1. Entropy Decoding
Reverses the entropy coding to convert the bitstream back into quantized coefficients.
2. Dequantization
Restores the quantized coefficients to their original range. Lossy compression results in some loss of detail.
3. Inverse Transformation
The inverse transformation (e.g., Inverse DCT) converts the frequency-domain coefficients back into the spatial domain, resulting in the reconstructed image.

# Reconstructed Image:-
The reconstructed image is an approximation of the original. Lossless compression results in an identical image, while lossy compression may introduce slight quality loss.
Popular Image Compression Techniques
1.	JPEG: Utilizes DCT, quantization, and entropy coding. It is a lossy compression method that balances quality and file size, making it ideal for photographs.
2.	PNG: Uses lossless compression with filtering and the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) algorithm.
3.	JPEG2000: Uses wavelet transform, offering superior quality at higher compression ratios than standard JPEG.
   
# Advantages and Challenges of Image Compression:-

# Advantages:
•	Reduced Storage Space: Smaller file sizes save disk space.
•	Faster Transmission: Compressed images transmit more quickly, reducing bandwidth usage.
•	Efficient Processing: Smaller images are easier to handle in computer vision tasks.

# Challenges:
•	Loss of Quality: Lossy compression can introduce visible artifacts.
•	Computational Complexity: Advanced techniques, like wavelet-based compression, can be computationally intensive.


# Diagram Explanation of the Image Compression Model
# The image compression model is divided into two main parts:
 
The diagram I have provided illustrates the image compression model and its corresponding decompression model in a simplified and block-based form. It consists of two main parts:
# (a) Encoder Block (Compression Process)
1.	Mapper: Converts the original image F(x,y)F(x, y)F(x,y) into a different domain using techniques like Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) or Wavelet Transform, making the data more compressible.
3.	Quantizer: Reduces the precision of mapped values. In lossy compression, less important details are discarded, resulting in data reduction.
4.	Symbol Encoder: Performs entropy coding (e.g., Huffman or Arithmetic coding) to convert the quantized data into a compressed bitstream. 
# (b) Decoder Block (Decompression Process)
1.	Symbol Decoder: Reconstructs the quantized data from the compressed bitstream using entropy decoding.
2.	Inverse Mapper: Converts the data back into the spatial domain using inverse transformations (e.g., Inverse DCT), resulting in the reconstructed image F′(x,y)F'(x, y)F′(x,y).
3.  Channel: The "Channel" represents the medium through which the compressed data is transmitted or stored, such as a storage device or communication network.


# Summary of the Compression and Decompression Process:-

# •	Encoding (Compression): 
The original image F(x,y)F(x, y)F(x,y) is transformed, quantized, and encoded to create a compressed bitstream.
# •	Decoding (Decompression): 
The bitstream is decoded, dequantized, and inverse-transformed to reconstruct the image F′(x,y)F'(x, y)F′(x,y).

This entire process reduces image size while balancing efficiency and quality, ensuring effective storage and transmission of image data.
In essence, the image compression model efficiently reduces redundancy in image data, maintaining a balance between compression ratio and quality to suit different applications, whether for lossless or lossy requirements.
